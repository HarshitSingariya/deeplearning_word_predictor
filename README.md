# DeepLearning_LSTM_WordPredictor

This repository contains a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks designed for next word prediction. The model is capable of learning from a given text dataset and predicting the subsequent word in a sequence.

## Model Deployment

A trained model on "The Verdict (1908) by Edith Wharton" is deployed on Hugging Face, allowing for easy access.

## Features

- Implements LSTM for next word prediction.
- Capable of training on any text dataset.
- Includes scripts for preprocessing, training, and prediction.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
